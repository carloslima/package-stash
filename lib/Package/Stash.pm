=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $stash = Package::Stash->new('Foo');
  $stash->add_package_symbol('%foo', {bar => 1});
  # $Foo::foo{bar} == 1
  $stash->has_package_symbol('$foo') # false
  my $namespace = $stash->namespace;
  *{ $namespace->{foo} }{HASH} # {bar => 1}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Manipulating stashes (Perl's symbol tables) is occasionally necessary, but
incredibly messy, and easy to get wrong. This module hides all of that behind a
simple API.

NOTE: Most methods in this class require a variable specification that includes
a sigil. If this sigil is absent, it is assumed to represent the IO slot.

=method new $package_name

Creates a new C<Package::Stash> object, for the package given as the only
argument.

=method name

Returns the name of the package that this object represents.

=method namespace

Returns the raw stash itself.

=method add_package_symbol $variable $value %opts

Adds a new package symbol, for the symbol given as C<$variable>, and optionally
gives it an initial value of C<$value>. C<$variable> should be the name of
variable including the sigil, so

  Package::Stash->new('Foo')->add_package_symbol('%foo')

will create C<%Foo::foo>.

Valid options (all optional) are C<filename>, C<first_line_num>, and
C<last_line_num>.

C<$opts{filename}>, C<$opts{first_line_num}>, and C<$opts{last_line_num}> can
be used to indicate where the symbol should be regarded as having been defined.
Currently these values are only used if the symbol is a subroutine ('C<&>'
sigil) and only if C<$^P & 0x10> is true, in which case the special C<%DB::sub>
hash is updated to record the values of C<filename>, C<first_line_num>, and
C<last_line_num> for the subroutine. If these are not passed, their values are
inferred (as much as possible) from C<caller> information.

This is especially useful for debuggers and profilers, which use C<%DB::sub> to
determine where the source code for a subroutine can be found.  See
L<http://perldoc.perl.org/perldebguts.html#Debugger-Internals> for more
information about C<%DB::sub>.

=method remove_package_glob $name

Removes all package variables with the given name, regardless of sigil.

=method has_package_symbol $variable

Returns whether or not the given package variable (including sigil) exists.

=method get_package_symbol $variable

Returns the value of the given package variable (including sigil).

=method get_or_add_package_symbol $variable

Like C<get_package_symbol>, except that it will return an empty hashref or
arrayref if the variable doesn't exist.

=cut

sub get_or_add_package_symbol {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->get_package_symbol(@_, vivify => 1);
}

=method remove_package_symbol $variable

Removes the package variable described by C<$variable> (which includes the
sigil); other variables with the same name but different sigils will be
untouched.

=method list_all_package_symbols $type_filter

Returns a list of package variable names in the package, without sigils. If a
C<type_filter> is passed, it is used to select package variables of a given
type, where valid types are the slots of a typeglob ('SCALAR', 'CODE', 'HASH',
etc). Note that if the package contained any C<BEGIN> blocks, perl will leave
an empty typeglob in the C<BEGIN> slot, so this will show up if no filter is
used (and similarly for C<INIT>, C<END>, etc).
